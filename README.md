# HaskellPlatformer
This is a Haskell platformer game project using [FreeGLUT](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net) and [ALUT](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ALUT).
Assets are provided by [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org)

Originally authored by A.Putra, A.Popenka, and M.McConchie and now extended with my individual enhancements.
